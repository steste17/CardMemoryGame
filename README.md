## Instructions

The main repo (aka. blank) repo for this project can be downloaded from [Fend Project Memory Game](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game). Clone the repo or download a zip version. 

To run this version of the game, clone or download the repo. Then open the `index.html` file in a browser. Have fun!

## Disclaimer

This repository is taken from the starter code for _all_ Udacity students under the Front End Web Development Nanodegree for the Memory Game project. Therefore, while the "skeleton" (html & css) are the same as other memory game projects, the `js/app.js` file was written using lots of Googling, understanding what other students had done in the Q&A Forum and sheer determination to get it done.

## PersonalNotes
- Overall approach: tried to refractor as much as possible and keep code organized
- Wonder if the `cleanDeck();` is necessary but it worked out well
- Go back and find a better way to reset the entire game without using `location.reload();`
- Review how to make the CSS of the pop up look nicer
- Look back over code to check performance and more efficient ways to complete
