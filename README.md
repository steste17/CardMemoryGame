## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## PersonalNotes
- Overall approach: tried to refractor as much as possible and keep code organized
- Wonder if the `cleanDeck();` is necessary but it worked out well
- Go back and find a better way to reset the entire game without using `location.reload();`
- Review how to make the CSS of the pop up look nicer
- Look back over code to check performance and more efficient ways to complete
